<h1><b>Data Science Portfolio</b></h1>

This repository contains a portfolio of Data Science projects completed by me (Josh Reed).

This portfolio aims to demonstrate the breadth and depth of my data science skillset, including both technical ability and situational judgement. I intend to upload more projects as and when I complete them, as part of my self-learning journey within data analytics and science.

For now, please feel free to view the contents of my first Kaggle competition, presented in a Jupyter notebook, where I sought to predict survival following the 1912 Titanic disaster. This is an end-to-end machine learning project comprising aspects of both feature engineering and selection and optimisation of a best fitting classification model. 

If you would like to contact me directly to discuss my portfolio or broader work within data analytics and science, please drop an e-mail to josh24990@msn.com.
